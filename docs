I reviewed the YAML status file and compared it with the Gloo documentation. Here are my observations on the issues we’re facing, along with some proposed steps for resolution:

AuthConfig Not Found: The status file indicates that the authConfig for grp-ent-customer-profile.v1-review-initial-98378 is missing, which suggests that either the configuration file is absent or incorrectly specified.

InvalidDestinationWarning: Several upstream services, such as grp-ent-my-accounts.v3-member-home-experience-canary, grp-ent-experience-data-life-events.v1-party-assessment-svc-canary, and grp-ent-xcache.v3-ifa-pnc-auto-canary, are showing “not found” warnings. This may point to missing or misconfigured route or upstream definitions in Gloo.
